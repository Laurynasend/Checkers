# Checkers
 
 Checkers app with casual interface and a decent engine that will give you a good challenge.
 There are 5 difficulties for all levels of players. 
 
 I encourage to try and beat this oldschool checker application :)
 
 
 Technical talk:
 
 Interface is written with Java Swing.
 
 Engine is governed by a popular search algorithm called Minimax. It is improved by an implementation of :
 1. Alpha - beta prunning
 2. Transposition tables (Using zobrist values)
 3. Iterative deepening
 
 All of these upgrades combined improved computer level of play by a huge margin which led to more fun gameplay
